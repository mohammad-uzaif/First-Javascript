#Key Points About JavaScript :
1]-Scripting Language – JavaScript is mainly used to add logic, interactivity, and behavior to web pages.
2]-Client-Side Execution – Runs directly in the user’s browser (no need for compilation like C++ or Java).
3]-Lightweight & Dynamic – Variables, functions, and objects can be created and changed while the program is running.
4]-Core of Web Development – Along with HTML (structure) and CSS (style), JavaScript is the 3rd pillar of web development.
$notes :✅ In short: JavaScript = The brain of the website (logic + interactivity).
