Memory management:-
âœ¨ JavaScript Memory Management â€“ Simplified

When we write code, our programs need memory to store data, variables, and objects. JavaScript automatically handles this through a process called Garbage Collection, but understanding it helps us write efficient code.

ðŸ”¹ How Memory Works in JS:

Memory Allocation â€“ When you create a variable, object, or function, JS allocates memory.

let user = { name: "Uzaif" }; // memory allocated


Memory Usage â€“ While the program runs, memory is used to store values and references.

Garbage Collection â€“ If nothing references a value anymore, the JS engine automatically frees it.

user = null; // previous object becomes garbage


ðŸ”¹ Common Memory Issues:

Memory Leaks happen when we forget to release references (e.g., unused event listeners, global variables).

Storing too many unused objects increases heap memory, slowing performance.

ðŸ”¹ Best Practices for Developers:

Use let/const (not var) to limit variable scope.

Remove event listeners when no longer needed.

Avoid keeping unnecessary global variables.

Use tools like Chrome DevTools â†’ Memory tab to detect leaks.

ðŸ’¡ Takeaway:
JS does memory management for us, but writing clean, optimized code ensures our apps stay fast and efficient ðŸš€.
